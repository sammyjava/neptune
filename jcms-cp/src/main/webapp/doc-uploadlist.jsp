  <b>Uploaded files</b> are image, audio and video files uploaded using the tool at the bottom of the content editor.  They are simply files residing on the site's file system, not listed in the site
  database.  Therefore, you should take care when deleting uploaded files, since you may make an image, audio or video go missing on a page.  If you don't need to delete an uploaded file, leave it on the site.
