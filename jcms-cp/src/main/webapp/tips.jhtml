<h3>TIPS</h3>

<p>
  <b>Use unique media file names.</b> Media files are shared throughout the site, so you should be careful to give them unique names.  For example, if you
  upload a PDF with the file name "report.pdf" and later on someone uploads a file with the same name, the one you uploaded will be overwritten.
  This can be particularly embarrassing in the case of audio files and images!
